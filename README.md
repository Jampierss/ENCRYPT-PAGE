<h1>Encript</h1>
Encript is a simple web application that allows users to encrypt and decrypt text using a custom substitution cipher. 
It was created as a fun project to practice JavaScript programming and web development skills.

<h2>Usage</h2>
The application includes two buttons: "Encrypt" and "Decrypt". 
To encrypt a message, simply enter the text you want to encrypt in the input field and click the "Encrypt" button. 
The app will apply the custom encryption algorithm to your message and display the encrypted text on the screen.
To decrypt a message, enter the encrypted text in the input field and click the "Decrypt" button. 
The app will reverse the encryption process and display the original text on the screen.
You can also copy the encrypted or decrypted text to your clipboard by clicking the "Copy" button.
